This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using **Logistic Regression**. It includes:
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning Model Training
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy: 80%)

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📂 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook
2. Click **"Run All"** to execute the entire code
3. Check model performance in the last section
